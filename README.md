This software application is meant to predict whether the user has Parkinson's disease based on the kinematics of their handwriting. It uses a drawing tablet to measure data such as velocity, acceleration, letter size, etc. to ultimately give a prediction for Parkinson's based on a scale from 0% to 100%.
